###Absolute
- An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor- instead of positioned relative to the viewport (fixed psotitioning)

- However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors(is default of static), it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.


###Relative
- An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

- used for scalable elements on pages

- Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted/shifted away from its normal position.
- Other content on the page will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
